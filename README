Little CPU
==========

Little CPU is an implementation of the RISCV 32 base ISA (I) in verilog.

You can run a simple test suite by installing the latest development version of icarus-verilog.
On OSX, you can install it using brew, and then the suite is just a make away:

  brew install icarus-verilog --HEAD
  make test

It is formally verified with: https://github.com/SymbioticEDA/riscv-formal

To run the formal test suite install SymbiYosys by following:
https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#installing

And then run:

  cd checks
  make
  make complete

I'm unreasonably proud and excited by this project, it was made with love, and I hope that it is a
good read. There's much more to come!
