# Architecture Decision Records

Load-bearing decisions for Little CPU. Each ADR records the context, the decision, why it was made,
and what it costs. Reversing one is fine — write a new ADR that supersedes it.

| # | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [0001](0001-finish-the-staged-rewrite.md) | Finish the staged rewrite rather than resurrect the serialized core | Accepted |
| [0002](0002-isa-target-rv32imc-zicsr.md) | ISA target is RV32IMC_Zicsr, machine mode only | Accepted |
| [0003](0003-dual-word-combinational-fetch-window.md) | Dual-word combinational fetch window for compressed instructions | Accepted |
| [0004](0004-stall-only-hazard-interlock.md) | Stall-only hazard interlock with a combinational-read regfile | Accepted |
| [0005](0005-traps-and-csrs-commit-in-decode.md) | Traps and CSR accesses are detected and committed in decode | Accepted |
| [0006](0006-port-the-wave-0-formal-harness.md) | Port the wave-0 formal harness; RVFI via per-stage shadow payloads | Accepted |
| [0007](0007-cxxrtl-is-the-primary-simulator.md) | cxxrtl is the primary simulator; iverilog is the microscope | Accepted |
| [0008](0008-test-memory-map-and-tohost-protocol.md) | Test memory map and the `tohost` protocol | Accepted |
| [0009](0009-stall-protocol-semantics.md) | Stall protocol — upstream freezes, downstream drains | Accepted |
| [0010](0010-muldiv-verification-under-altops.md) | A randomized differential bench is the primary mul/div guarantee | Accepted |
| [0011](0011-misalignment-detection-stays-in-accessor-until-m3.md) | Misalignment detection stays in the accessor until M3 | Accepted |

0001–0007 came from the design brief
([`docs/ideas/finish-the-rewrite.md`](../ideas/finish-the-rewrite.md)). 0008–0011 came out of
sprint planning, when the panel ran the toolchain and found the brief's assumptions needed
resolving before work could start. 0010 supplements 0006; 0011 scopes 0005.

## Deferred decisions

These are deliberately *not* decided yet. Each requires a new ADR before being built, because each
trades away simplicity the current design depends on.

- **Forwarding network** — CPI-only optimisation on top of ADR-0004's stall-only interlock. Safe to
  add post-verification; unsafe to add while the core is unverified.
- **Radix-4 divider / early termination** — CPI-only. Roughly doubles comparator and mux logic on a
  part already at 55–70% utilisation, and the payoff is largely absorbed by ADR-0007 (cxxrtl) and by
  the 65→32 iteration-count fix.
- **negedge-BRAM regfile** — escape hatch if ADR-0004's flip-flop regfile blocks timing closure.
- **FPGA timing closure / nextpnr flow** — including ADR-0003's second ROM read becoming interleaved
  16-bit banks. Post-M4.
- **Interrupts** (`mie`/`mip` real rather than read-only zero) — no interrupt sources exist.
- **Spike or Sail co-simulation** — riscv-formal is the oracle. Revisit only if formal and
  simulation ever disagree.
